Questions are organized by number in their respective folders.
To call a code in the main function, replace the input to the 
run_and_print function with the corresponding question in the 
form <QUESTION_FOLDER>::<QUESTIONNUMBER>::<QUESTIONNUMBER>.
The main function will return the answer to the question and the 
time it took to generate the answer.
